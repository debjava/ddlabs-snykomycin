# 🌟 Why Snykomycin: 
Security vulnerabilities are reported periodically by the Snyk system, requiring developers to manually retrieve information
and update dependencies. It is a dilatory process and impedes the momentum of development.
Snykomycin eliminates this friction by enabling rapid dependency upgrades within a minute and accelerates development velocity.

# ❤️ Why You’ll Love It
**Synkomycin** is a small light-weight plugin which acts as a small antidote to security vulnerabilities without any side effect.
It is an attempt to turn chaos into clarity during development.

# ⚠️ Limitations:
At present, Snykomycin does not provide automated upgrade, originating from transitive dependencies.
Active development efforts are underway to extend support and 
deliver comprehensive resolution for all transitive dependency issues in future releases.
